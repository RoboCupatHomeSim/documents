This system requires a Windows computer to run SIGVerse as well as an Ubuntu computer to run ROS 2 nodes created by the participants.  
Connect the two computers using a wired Ethernet switch.

Please see [the official SIGVerse website] for information about SIGVerse.

For details on setting up the environment, please refer to the [environment](Environment.md) page.
