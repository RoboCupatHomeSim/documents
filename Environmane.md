The basic configuration for the RoboCup@Home Simulation requires a Windows computer to run SIGVerse as well as an Ubuntu computer to run ROS nodes created by the participants. These two computers should be connected to a switching hub.  

Please see [the official SIGVerse website] for information about SIGVerse.
